# Cobhin-Tracks

After being tired of checking for vaccination slots every minute of everyday, here's presenting a simple chrome extension built to do exactly that for any given pin-code in India. This application is powered by the APIsetu open apis for covid 19 vaccine (cowin)

## Features

- Track vaccination availability on click of a button by just entering your pin code. (The feature is right now available for only 18+)
- Caching of pin code. No need to enter pin code repeatedly. Just click `track` to get updates.
- Will provide a sound alert whenever a slot is found for the pin code previously entered. (don't forget to turn that volume up) 

## Getting Started
